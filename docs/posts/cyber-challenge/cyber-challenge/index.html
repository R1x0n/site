      <p>Cyber Challenge, 3-month course in which we received a ‚Äútraining‚Äù on various topics of computer security.
Cyberchallenge is an event that is brought to the national level, it is also found in Switzerland, the focus is to find the best guys in this field but also to present it to the less experienced.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-cyber-challenge-is-structured">How the Cyber Challenge is structured</h3>
<p>Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãChallenge is divided into lessons, every Friday from 2:00 pm to 8:00 pm at the Polytechnic University of Milan, for a total of 72 hours.
Each lesson deals with a specific vulnerability inherent to a particular topic.</p>
<p>All the lessons begin with two hours of theory and end with a very long practical part, wherewith the support of teachers an attempt is made to solve as many challenges as possible.
Below is the complete list of all the topics and vulnerabilities discussed:

<p>This was a very interesting experience for me, which gave me the opportunity to learn about many topics and techniques unknown to me.</p>
<p>I, therefore, thank the Milan Polytechnic and especially Prof. Stefano Zanero for allowing me to participate in this course.
It was for me a great honor and also a great gratification to receive a certificate for participation personally signed by Prof. Zanero. <a href="/static/cert/cyberchallenge.pdf">(link)</a></p>
